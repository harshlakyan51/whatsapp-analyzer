## 📦 How to Export WhatsApp Chat

> 📱 On WhatsApp (Android):

1. Open the chat you want to analyze.

3. Select **Without Media**.
4. Upload the `.txt` file to the web app.

## 🧠 How It Works (Architecture Breakdown)

### 🔹 Step 1: Preprocessing

* `preprocessor.py` cleans raw chat data using:

  * Regex to parse messages
  * Convert timestamps to datetime objects
  * Extract usernames, dates, and times

### 🔹 Step 2: Feature Computation

* `helper.py` contains all logic to:

  * Count messages, words, media, links
  * Generate timelines, heatmaps, emoji counts
  * Create word clouds and bar plots

### 🔹 Step 3: UI & Visualizations

* `main.py` builds the UI using Streamlit

  * Sidebar for file upload and user selection
  * Trigger button for analysis
  * Layout sections using `st.columns()` and `st.pyplot()`
  * Combines helper functions with visual outputs

---

## 📌 Ideal For

* Data Science portfolios
* Analytics and dashboard projects
* Machine Learning preprocessing demonstrations
* NLP and Text Mining foundations
* Real-world Python + Streamlit showcase
